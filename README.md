# DataIO_29B_1Meg
Data I/O 29B 1MB or 512KB board

This board plugs in the bus connector inside the Data I/O 29B device programmer. It provides 1Mbyte RAM storage or 512K if populating only one SRAM IC.
See the image directory before building and installing it. The pin header connector should have at least 50mm pin length to allow enough vertical clearance from the 29B mainboard.

If you have a model 29A (not B) and you feel like experimenting, contact me :)

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
